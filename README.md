# Simple Inventory Management System

## Overview
This project is a bash script-based inventory management system designed for educational purposes in the Systems Programming course.

Each item's information is stored in individual text files within a local directory, emphasizing fundamental file handling and shell scripting techniques.

## Features
- **Create**: Add new inventory items with details such as item name, quantity, and description.
- **Read**: Retrieve and display details of existing items.
- **Update**: Modify the details of existing items in the inventory.
- **Delete**: Remove items from the inventory.
- **Data Logging**: Track all operations with timestamps in a log file to maintain a history of changes.

## Usage
